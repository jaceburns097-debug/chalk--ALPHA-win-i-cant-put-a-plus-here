# chalk--ALPHA-win
this is a NEWER version of chalk universal 4.1!!!!. unfortunately, unlike chalk universal which was purposely designed to run on most os's, chalk++ was made, tested, and ran on windows 11. i am not sure if it will run on mac/linux ect. especially on linux (ubunu/debian) you may need to install tkinter, threading, re, and queue.
